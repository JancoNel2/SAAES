# Shard-Based Adaptive Averaging and Exit Strategy (SAAES)

## Abstract

The Shard-Based Adaptive Averaging and Exit Strategy (SAAES) is a novel hybrid trading approach designed for equity and asset trading. It fragments trading capital into hundreds or thousands of discrete units ("shards") and dynamically allocates them in response to price movements. The strategy accumulates assets when prices fall, with adaptive buy sizing based on the size of the dip, and selectively exits profitable positions when prices rise. Unlike traditional dollar-cost averaging or grid trading, SAAES offers intelligent position management with built-in risk controls and precise profit targeting.

## 1. Motivation

Most traditional averaging strategies — including DCA, Martingale, and fixed-step grid trading — suffer from at least one of the following issues:

- Inefficient capital allocation in unpredictable markets
- Uncontrolled exposure when prices move sharply against the position
- Lack of intelligent exit logic (e.g., selling entire positions or none at all)

SAAES aims to solve these problems by using capital in a fragment-based manner while optimizing entry and exit conditions in real-time.

## 2. Core Mechanics

### 2.1 Capital Fragmentation ("Shards")

Total trading capital is divided into *N* equal parts called shards (e.g., 1,000 or 10,000). This creates micro-capital units that can be individually deployed or reclaimed depending on market conditions.

### 2.2 Adaptive Buying on Price Drops

At each price update:
- If the price has dropped since the last check, the bot buys more of the asset.
- The number of shards allocated is proportional to the percentage drop.
- A minimum of 1 shard is always allocated, provided it covers at least one unit of the asset.

This provides natural dip-buying behavior with depth-based responsiveness.

### 2.3 Selective Profit-Taking on Price Increase

- If the price has increased, the bot checks logs of all past purchases.
- Any entries where the current price exceeds the entry price are eligible for selling.
- Only profitable entries are sold. Loss-making positions are held for later recovery.

## 3. Risk Management

- **Capital Ceiling:** Never deploy more than total allocated shards.
- **Minimum Shard Size:** Ensure each shard can execute a trade of meaningful size (avoiding dust orders).
- **Exposure Controls:** Optional constraints can be set on max % exposure or position lifespan.

## 4. Implementation Notes

- **API-Agnostic:** Buy/sell logic is abstracted; users must implement `buy()` and `sell()` for their brokerage.
- **Live Data Loop:** Designed to run continuously with live pricing data.
- **Logging System:** Each buy is logged with quantity, price, and shard ID to track profitability per position.

## 5. (Optional) Backtesting / Simulation

_Section reserved for future work._  
The strategy can be tested using historical tick data or run on a paper trading account with full logging enabled.

## 6. Conclusion

SAAES is a modular, intelligent, and risk-aware trading strategy that offers significant improvements over classic averaging techniques. Its shard-based logic allows for fine-grained control, while its smart sell mechanism ensures profits are realized without liquidating unprofitable positions prematurely.

This paper outlines the framework and invites further development, backtesting, and implementation by the trading and coding community.
