# SAAES - Shard-Allocated Adaptive Exchange Strategy

One night I had this idea in a dream — literally.

The core concept is documented in [`Whitepaper.md`](Whitepaper.md). It outlines a novel trading approach based on adaptive shard allocation, buy/sell decision-making, and real-time price tracking. This repository serves as the public record of the idea.

The legal license for this work is available in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

In the coming days, I plan to release both Python and C++ model implementations for SAAES. However, I’m currently crammed for time — especially with Accounting test tomorrow — so releases might be slow.

Stay tuned.
